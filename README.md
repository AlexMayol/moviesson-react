# Moviesson React

[GitHub repository](https://github.com/AlexMayol/moviesson-react)

[Live demo](https://modest-swartz-9127e6.netlify.app/)

## Build the project 
1. `npm i`
2. `npm run start` to launch the development environment.
3. `npm run build` to generate a production-ready app.

### App details
`MovieCard.jsx` is a React Class component. The rest of the componentes are functional components that use React Hooks.

The styling is a mix of [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and my own `.scss` styles.

All the movies images are placed in `publid/assets`, and the original JSON was converted into a JS object and placed in `src/data/movies.js` as the initial source of content.
